Description: Perform forensic handwriting analysis of two scanned handwritten documents. This package implements the statistical method described by Madeline Johnson and Danica Ommen (2021) <doi:10.1002/sam.11566>. Similarity measures and a random forest produce a score-based likelihood ratio that quantifies the strength of the evidence in favor of the documents being written by the same writer or different writers.
